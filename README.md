# Master Project: Adversarial Attacks on Graph Embeddings Based on Text Dataset

## Overview

This repository contains the code, datasets, and documentation for the Master's project titled "Adversarial Attacks on Graph Embeddings Based on Text Dataset." The project focuses on exploring and implementing adversarial attacks on graph-based data models, particularly those that leverage text datasets.

A significant aspect of this project is the inclusion and analysis of both Meta Attack and Net Attack strategies. These approaches are integrated into our study to serve as benchmarks, offering a comprehensive evaluation framework for comparing various adversarial attack methodologies in the context of graph embeddings. This inclusion aims to provide a deeper understanding of the resilience and vulnerabilities of graph-based models against different types of adversarial strategies.
